     <li><h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
       <p>alert() opens a dialog window, while console.log() just writes to the console (like terminal). </p></li>
     <li><h2>What's one situation where you might use an alert() to tell the user something?</h2>
       <p>If they want to leave a page before it's done saving something they input, or if you try to  refresh and it could mean resending information.</p></li>
     <li><h2>What's one way that alert() might get obnoxious?</h2>
       <p>If you want to leave a website and it won't let you.</p></li>
     <li><h2>Would it make sense to use console.log() to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>
       <p>No, because people never open it.</p></li>
     <li><h2>What's one way that console.log() might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
       <p>Debugging, like using binding.pry</p></li>
     <li><h2>When do the console.log() statements get run? Is it before the first alert() gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?</h2>
       <p>The script runs in the order it's written. </p></li>
     <li><h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
       <p> :) </p></li>
