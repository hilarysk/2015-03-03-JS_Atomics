     <li><h2>What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use typeof and console.log() to help with this.</h2>
       <p>It's a string, even if they input a number.</p></li>
     <li><h2>What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?</h2>
       <p>It's an empty string.</p></li>
     <li><h2>How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?</h2>
       <p>Oh yeah, easily. The only one I had to adjust was "name", because it was showing up as a different color and I assumed that meant it was a reserved keyword.</p></li>
     <li><h2>If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?</h2>
       <p>Depends, I guess. If your variable were named "answer2" and you changed the question, "answer2" would still apply. If it were more specific, maybe just add a comment where you declare the variable? Again, depends on how many other places you would need to change the variable name.</p></li>
     <li><h2>In these exercises, we use prompt() to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use prompt() -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with prompt()? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use prompt()?</h2>
       <p>They use a form, which would definitely be less annoying for the user, but if you absolutely need the information / or need the information before the page loads, then a prompt could be better-suited for the task.</p></li>
     <li><h2>Research prompt() -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?</h2>
       <p>You have to use the JQuery library.</p></li>
     <li><h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
       <p> :) </p></li>
